# Changes for Module::Extract::Namespaces

1.01 - Tue May  7 19:19:26 2013

0.14_02 - Tue May  7 19:17:14 2013
	* Implement from_module so you can specify a namespace
	instead of a filename

0.14_02 - Sat Apr 30 11:44:49 2011
	* I forgot to add the lexer hint for ::Package for the 
	monkey patch. That patch is only there until PPI updates
	for the patch.

0.14_01 - Fri Apr 29 08:01:08 2011
	* Handle the Perl 5.12 package NAME VERSION BLOCK syntax,
	even if you aren't using Perl 5.12. It's just PPI, so it's
	not actually running code.

0.14 - Wed Oct 29 12:59:58 2008
	* Adding an error() method so you can check what went wrong.
	That means no more carping and stomping all over your terminal
	or log file unless you want that.

0.13 - Tue Sep 16 21:40:36 2008
	* Adding bits to META.yml with MakeMaker's new META_MERGE feature
	* Moved everything to github, so the new source URL is, well, new

0.12 - Sat Aug  9 08:59:42 2008
	* This is still an early version of the module
	* This version takes more care to catch PPI problems

0.11_01 - Fri Aug  8 06:06:48 2008
	* Handle the PDOMs a bit more carefully in case things
	go terribly wrong

0.10_01 - Thu Apr  3 11:48:51 2008
	* This is the initial release while I'm at the Oslo QA Hackathon
	* Extract the package declarations in a file to see which namespaces
	are in it
