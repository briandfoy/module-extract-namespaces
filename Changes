# Changes for Module::Extract::Namespaces

0.14 - Wed Oct 29 12:59:58 2008
	* Adding an error() method so you can check what went wrong.
	That means no more carping and stomping all over your terminal
	or log file unless you want that.

0.13 - Tue Sep 16 21:40:36 2008
	* Adding bits to META.yml with MakeMaker's new META_MERGE feature
	* Moved everything to github, so the new source URL is, well, new

0.12 - Sat Aug  9 08:59:42 2008
	* This is still an early version of the module
	* This version takes more care to catch PPI problems

0.11_01 - Fri Aug  8 06:06:48 2008
	* Handle the PDOMs a bit more carefully in case things
	go terribly wrong

0.10_01 - Thu Apr  3 11:48:51 2008
	* This is the initial release while I'm at the Oslo QA Hackathon
	* Extract the package declarations in a file to see which namespaces
	are in it
